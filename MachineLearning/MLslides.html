# Machine Learning
The next unit of this class will cover machine learning. But first, let&#39;s discuss the difference between Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI).


---
## What is machine learning? What is AI?
What is machine learning?


- **ML:** Allowing computers to learn for themselves without being explicitly programmed
 - **USPS:** Computers read handwritten addresses and sort mail accordingly
 - **Google:** AlphaGo, AlphaZero (computers that are world-class chess, go players)
 - **Apple/Amazon/Microsoft:** Siri, Alexa, Cortana voice assistants can understand human speech
 - **Facebook:** automatically finds faces in a photo and tags them to the corresponding user
- In each of the above examples, the machine is &quot;learning&quot; to do something only humans had previously been able to do
- Put differently, the machine was not programmed to read numbers or recognize voices -- it was given a bunch of examples of numbers and human voices and came up with a way to predict what&#39;s a number or a voice and what isn&#39;t

What is AI?


- **AI:** Constructing machines (robots, computers) to think and act like human beings

Thus, machine learning is a (large) subset of AI


---
## Machine learning's role in data science

- In data science, machine learning closely resembles statistics.
- Why? Because a lot of data science is about finding &quot;insights&quot; or &quot;policies&quot; in your data that can be used to increase profits or improve quality of life in some other dimension.
- Finding &quot;insights&quot; is about finding correlative and causal relationships among variables
- Statistics is the science that has the vast majority of these tools


---
## Machine learning vs. econometrics

- **Machine Learning** is all about maximizing out-of-sample prediction
- **Econometrics** is all about finding &quot;unbiased&quot; and &quot;consistent&quot; parameter estimates (e.g. making sure that the estimated parameters of the model will converge to the &quot;true&quot; population values given a large enough sample size)
- **Machine Learning** is all about finding y&#770;
- **Econometrics** is all about finding &beta;&#770;


---
## The fundamental objective of Machine Learning
The fundamental objective is to maximize out-of-sample fit


- But how is this possible given that -- by definition -- we don&#39;t see what&#39;s not in our sample?
- The solution is to choose functions that predict well in-sample, but penalize them from being too complex.
- **Regularization** is the tool by which in-sample fit is penalized. That is, regularization prevents overly complex functions from being chosen by the algorithm
- **Overfitting** is when we put too much emphasis on in-sample fit, leading us to make poor out-of-sample fit


---
## Elements of Machine Learning
The following are the basic elements of machine learning in data science:


1. Loss function (this is how one measures how well a particular algorithm predicts in- or out-of-sample)
1. Algorithm (a way to generate prediction rules in-sample that can generate to out-of-sample)
1. Training data (the sample on which the algorithm estimates)
1. Validation data (the sample on which algorithm tuning occurs)
1. Test data (the &quot;out-of-sample&quot; data which is used to measure predictive power on unseen cases)

The algorithm typically comes with **tuning parameters** which are ways to regularize the in-sample fit

**Cross-validation** is how tuning parameters are tuned.


---
## Example

- Suppose you want to predict housing prices (this is the &quot;hello world&quot; of machine learning)
- You have a large number of relevant variables
- What would you do?
 - You would want to have a model that can detect non-linear relationships (like the USPS handwriting reader)
 - You would also want to have a model that you can tractably estimate
 - And a model that will predict well out-of-sample


---
### One option: a separate dummy variable for every house

- In this scenario, you run `lm(log(price) ~ as.factor(houseID))`
- What you get is a separate price prediction for every single house
- But what to do when given a new house that&#39;s not in the sample?
 - Which house in the sample is the one you should use for prediction?
- The resulting prediction will have horrible out-of-sample fit, even though it has perfect in-sample fit
- This is a classic case of **overfitting**
- We say that this prediciton has **high variance** (i.e. the algorithm thinks random noise is something that is important to the model)


---
### Another option: house price is a linear function of square footage

- In this scenario, you simply run `lm(log(price) ~ sqft)`
- When given a new house with a given square footage, you will only look at the square footage to predict the price of the new house
- This algorithm will result in **underfitting** because the functional form and features it uses for prediction are too simplistic
- We say that this prediction has **high bias** (i.e. the algorithm does not think enough variation is important to the model)


---
## Bias-variance tradeoff
The **bias-variance tradeoff** refers to the fact that we need to find a model that is complex enough to generalize to new datasets, but is simple enough that it doesn&#39;t &quot;hallucinate&quot; random noise as being important

The way to optimally trade off bias and variance is via **regularization**

The following graphic from p. 194 of Hastie, Tsibshirani, and Friedman&#39;s *Elements of Statistical Learning* illustrates this tradeoff:

![Source: p. 194 of *Elements of Statistical Learning*](../Graphics/biasVarianceHTFp194.png "Bias-Variance Tradeoff")


---
## Regularization methods

1. Regression models (OLS or logistic)
 - L0 (Subset selection): penalize objective function by sum of the parameters &ne;0
 - L1 (LASSO): penalize objective function by sum of absolute value of parameters
 - L2 (Ridge): penalize objective function by sum of square of parameters 
 - Elastic net: penalize by a weighted sum of L1 and L2
1. Tree models
 - Depth, number of leaves, minimal leaf size, other criteria
1. Random forests
 - Number of trees, complexity of each tree, other criteria
1. Nearest neighbors
 - Number of neighbors
1. Neural networks
 - Number of layers, number of neurons per layer, connectivity between neurons (i.e. via L1/L2 regularization)
1. Support Vector Machine
 - L1/L2 regularization
1. Naive bayes
 - Naturally geared towards not overfitting, but can be regularized with iterative variable selection algorithms (similar to stepwise/stagewise regression)

## Visualization of different predictors
The following graphic shows a visualization of different classification algorithms, across two features (call them X and Y). Note the stark differences in the prediction regions.

---
## Combined predictors
Often you can get a better prediction by combining multiple sets of prediction. We call these **combined predictors**. 

You can think of the combined predictor as a &quot;committee of experts.&quot; Each &quot;expert&quot; votes on the outcome and votes are aggregated in such a way that the resulting prediction ends up being better than any individual component prediction.

3 types of combined predictors (cf. Mullainathan &amp; Spiess, 2017):


1. Bagging (unweighted average of predictors from bootstrap draws)
1. Boosting (linear combination of predictions of a residual)
1. Ensemble (weighted combination of different predictors)

Combined predictors are regularized in the number of draws, number of iterations, or structure of the weights.


---
## Visualization of combined predictors
The following graphic shows a similar visualization as above, but now incorporates an ensemble prediction region. This provides some solid intuition for why ensemble predictors usually perform better than the predictions from any one algorithm.

## Measuring prediction accuracy
How do we measure prediction accuracy? It depends on if our target variable is continuous or categorical


- **If continuous:** Use *Mean Squared Error (MSE)* which is equal to the sum of the squared differences between y and y&#770; divided by the sample size. Sometimes the *Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)* is used, which is the square root of this quantity. You may also see the *Mean Absolute Error (MAE)* which is the sum of the absolute value of the differences between y and y&#770; divided by the sample size.
- **If binary:** Use the *confusion matrix* which compares how often y and y&#770; agree with each other (i.e. for what fraction of cases y&#770; = 0 when y = 0)

Example confusion matrix

|   |  y&#770; |   | 
|--|--|--|
|  y |  0 |  1 | 
|  0 |  True negative |  False positive | 
|  1 |  False negative |  True positive | 


---
## Using the confusion matrix
The three most commonly used quantities that are computed from the confusion matrix are:


1. **sensitivity (aka recall):** what fraction of y = 1 have y&#770; = 1 ? (What is the true positive rate?)
1. **specificity:** what fraction of y = 0 have y&#770; = 0 ? (What is the true negative rate?)
1. **precision:** what fraction of y&#770; = 1 have y = 1 ? (What is the rate at which positive predictions are true?)

The goal is to trade off Type I and Type II errors in classification. The **F1 score** is the most common way to quantify this tradeoff.


- F1 score = 2/(1/recall  +  1/precision); a number in [0,1] with 1 being best
- It is the harmonic mean of recall and precision

There are a bunch of other quantities that one could compute from the confusion matrix, but we won&#39;t cover any of those.


---
## Why use the confusion matrix?
When assessing the predictive accuracy of a classification problem, we want to make sure that we can&#39;t &quot;game&quot; the accuracy measure by always predicting &quot;negative&quot; (or always predicting &quot;positive&quot;). This is critical for cases like classifying emails as &quot;spam&quot; or &quot;ham&quot; because of the relative paucity of &quot;spam&quot; messages.

In other words, if spam messages are only 1% of all messages seen, we don&#39;t want to be able to always predict &quot;ham&quot; and have that be a better measure of accuracy than actually trying to pin down the 1% of spam messages.

The F1 measure attempts to quantify the tradeoff between Type I and Type II errors (false negatives and false positives) that would be rampant if we were to always predict &quot;ham&quot; in the email example.


---
## Cross validation
How do we decide what level of complexity our algorithm should be, especially when we can&#39;t see out-of-sample?

The answer is we choose values of the **tuning parameters** that maximize out-of-sample prediction

for example:


- the &lambda; that comes in front of L1, L2, and elastic net regularization
- the maximum depth of the tree or the min. number of observations within each leaf
- etc.


---
## Splitting the sample
To peform cross-validation, one needs to split the sample. There are differing opinions on this:

Camp A (&quot;Holdout&quot;)


1. Training data (~70%)
1. Test (&quot;holdout&quot;) data (~30%)

Camp B (&quot;Cross-validation&quot;)


1. Training data (~60%)
1. Validation data (~20%)
1. Test data (~20%)

Sample is split randomly, **or** randomly according to how it was generated (e.g. if it&#39;s panel data, sample *units*, not observations)

It is ideal to follow the &quot;Cross-validation&quot; camp, but in cases where you don&#39;t have many observations (training examples), you may have to go the &quot;Holdout&quot; route.


---
## k-fold cross-validation
Due to randomness in our data, it may be better to do the cross validation multiple times. To do so, we take the 80% training-plus-validation sample and randomly divide it into the 60/20 components k number of times. Typically k is between 3 and 10. (See graphic below)

![Source: Brant Deppa, Winona State Univ.](../Graphics/k-foldCV.png "Illustration of k-fold cross validation")

In the extreme, one can also do *nested* k-fold cross-validation, wherein the test set is shuffled some number of times and the k-fold CV is repeated each time. So we would end up with &quot;3k&quot; fold CV, for example. For simplicity, we&#39;ll only use simple k-fold CV in this course.


---
## How to do all of this in R
There are a couple of nice packages in R that will do k-fold cross validation for you, and will work with a number of commonly used prediction algorithms


1. `caret`
1. `mlr`

`caret` likely still has a strong following, but `mlr` is up-and-coming and has a better user interface. We&#39;ll be using `mlr` for the rest of this unit of the course

In Python, `scikit-learn` is the workhorse machine learning frontend.


---
## How to use mlr
You need to tell `mlr` the following information before it will run:


1. Training data (which will end up being split k ways when doing cross-validation)
1. Testing data
1. The task at hand (e.g. regression or classification)
1. The validation scheme (e.g. 3-fold, 5-fold, or 10-fold CV)
1. The method used to tune the parameters of the algorithm (e.g. &lambda; for LASSO)
1. The prediction algorithm (e.g. &quot;decision tree&quot;)
1. The parameters of the prediction algorithm that need to be cross-validated (e.g. tree depth, &lambda;, etc.)

For a complete list of prediction algorithms supported by `mlr`, see [here](http://mlr-org.github.io/mlr-tutorial/devel/html/integrated_learners/index.html)


---
## Simple example
Let&#39;s start by doing linear regression on a well-known dataset: the Boston housing data from UC Irivne:

```r
housing <- read.table("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/housing.data")
names(housing) <- c("crim","zn","indus","chas","nox","rm","age","dis","rad","tax","ptratio","b","lstat","medv")

# From UC Irvine's website (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/housing.names)
#    1. CRIM      per capita crime rate by town
#    2. ZN        proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 
#                 25,000 sq.ft.
#    3. INDUS     proportion of non-retail business acres per town
#    4. CHAS      Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds 
#                 river; 0 otherwise)
#    5. NOX       nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
#    6. RM        average number of rooms per dwelling
#    7. AGE       proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
#    8. DIS       weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
#    9. RAD       index of accessibility to radial highways
#    10. TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
#    11. PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
#    12. B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks 
#                 by town
#    13. LSTAT    % lower status of the population
#    14. MEDV     Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
```

---
## OLS
```r
# Add some other features
housing$lmedv <- log(housing$medv)
housing$medv <- NULL
housing$dis2 <- housing$dis^2
housing$chasNOX <- housing$crim * housing$nox

# Break up the data:
n <- nrow(housing)
train <- sample(n, size = .8*n)
test  <- setdiff(1:n, train)
housing.train <- housing[train,]
housing.test  <- housing[test, ]

# Define the task:
theTask <- makeRegrTask(id = "taskname", data = housing.train, target = "lmedv")
print(theTask)

# tell mlr what prediction algorithm we'll be using (OLS)
predAlg <- makeLearner("regr.lm")

# Set resampling strategy (here let's do 6-fold CV)
resampleStrat <- makeResampleDesc(method = "CV", iters = 6)

# Do the resampling
sampleResults <- resample(learner = predAlg, task = theTask, resampling = resampleStrat, measures=list(rmse))

# Mean RMSE across the 6 folds
print(sampleResults$aggr)
```
Now, there&#39;s not much to do here, since there is no regularization in OLS. But you can see that there is quite a bit of variation in the RMSE based on which sample you use.


---
## LASSO
Now let&#39;s repeat but instead use the LASSO estimator from the `glmnet` package

Since `mlr` is awesome, we only need to load the package, reset the `makeLearner` function, and add the tuning over the &lambda; parameter

```r
library(glmnet)
# Tell it a new prediction algorithm
predAlg <- makeLearner("regr.glmnet")

# Search over penalty parameter lambda and force elastic net parameter to be 1 (LASSO)
modelParams <- makeParamSet(makeNumericParam("lambda",lower=0,upper=1),makeNumericParam("alpha",lower=1,upper=1))

# Take 50 random guesses at lambda within the interval I specified above
tuneMethod <- makeTuneControlRandom(maxit = 50L)

# Do the tuning
tunedModel <- tuneParams(learner = predAlg,
                        task = theTask,
                        resampling = resampleStrat,
                        measures = rmse,       # RMSE performance measure, this can be changed to one or many
                        par.set = modelParams,
                        control = tuneMethod,
                        show.info = TRUE)
```

---
## LASSO (continued)
The workhorse of the cross-validation is done by calling the `tuneParams` function. Once we have that, we need only to train the alogrithm with the optimal parameters and then use them for prediction

```r
# Apply the optimal algorithm parameters to the model
predAlg <- setHyperPars(learner=predAlg, par.vals = tunedModel$x)

# Verify performance on cross validated sample sets
resample(predAlg,theTask,resampleStrat,measures=list(rmse))

# Train the final model
finalModel <- train(learner = predAlg, task = theTask)

# Predict in test set!
prediction <- predict(finalModel, newdata = housing.test)

print(head(prediction$data))
```

---
## Ridge regression
We could do ridge regression on the same data by instead setting `alpha` to be 0 (instead of 1). In this case, all we would need to do is adjust the `makeParamSet()` function, re-call the tuning function, re-compute the in-sample fit of the tuned model, and re-compute the out-of-sample fit of the optimally tuned model:

```r
# Search over penalty parameter lambda and force elastic net parameter to be 0 (ridge)
modelParams <- makeParamSet(makeNumericParam("lambda",lower=0,upper=1),makeNumericParam("alpha",lower=0,upper=0))

# Do the tuning again
tunedModel <- tuneParams(learner = predAlg,
                        task = theTask,
                        resampling = resampleStrat,
                        measures = rmse,       # RMSE performance measure, this can be changed to one or many
                        par.set = modelParams,
                        control = tuneMethod,
                        show.info = TRUE)

# Apply the optimal algorithm parameters to the model
predAlg <- setHyperPars(learner=predAlg, par.vals = tunedModel$x)

# Verify performance on cross validated sample sets
resample(predAlg,theTask,resampleStrat,measures=list(rmse))

# Train the final model
finalModel <- train(learner = predAlg, task = theTask)

# Predict in test set!
prediction <- predict(finalModel, newdata = housing.test)
```
This showcases the nicest feature of the `mlr` package: we are still using the same algorithm, data, and cross-validation scheme, so we don&#39;t need to tell it those parameters again. We do, however, need to tell it to tune to the new parameter space (in this case, ridge instead of LASSO).
