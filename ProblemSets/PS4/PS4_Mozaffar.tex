\begin{document} \maketitle \section{Web Scraping Sources} Specifically 
for my project, I'll be scraping from companies' data to get information 
like their growth, annual revenue, personnel, etc. I'll also be scraping 
from Freedom House for their data on market conditions at particular 
points in time. I will also be attempting to scrape from some government 
sources to try and get a sense of the antitrust legal landscape at 
various points in time. \section{Questions} \subsection{Problem 5: JSON 
practice} d) This is a vector \subsection{Problem 6: SparkR practice} 4) 
df1 is a data.frame object and df is a SparkDataFrame object; 5) using 
the select command on df1 throws an error because it's a command 
specifically for Spark but the object is a regular, non-Spark data 
frame; 6) Using the filter command does the same thing for the same 
reason \end{document}
